# Original Prusa i3 MK2S - with Dollo frame


Original Prusa i3 MK2S is a 3D printer project maintained by PRUSA RESEARCH.
Originates in RepRap project.
Dollo3D is a printer project originally from Ben and Benjamin Engel.
Later updates and maintenance by spegelius.

This repository contains SCAD files and STLs of the printed parts. Original
Prusa files have been modified to fit Dollo frame where needed.

## What?
Idea is to use parts left from MK2S -> MK2.5 upgrade and build a MK2/Dollo hybrid. As there's no frame left over from the upgrade,
Dollo parts are going to be used in creating one. Also some small modifications and improvements will be implemented:
* more z height
* belt tensioners for X and Y


## BOM (non-printer parts):

- leftovers from MK2S -> MK2.5 hw upgrade:
  * MK42 bed
  * extruder: printed parts, hobbed gear, PINDA probe, hotend fan, nuts and bolts
  * all needed linear bearings
  * all needed smooth rods
  * X cable spiral wrap
  * assorted nuts and bolts, spare zip ties
- stuff to purchase
  * PSU (240W or better)
  * X, Y, 2x Z and E stepper motors
  * 2x Z 8mm leadscrews ~350mm(and couplers if not purchasing motors that have integrated leadscrews)
  * controller. MiniRambo is the original board, I hope to be able to use RAMPS (depends if fw can be ported)
  * E3Dv6 hotend (minus hotend fan)
  * 50mm radial fan for part cooling
  * GT2 belt (couple of meters)
  * 2x GT2 Pulley (16 Tooth)
  * 2x 623h bearing housing
  * some wire for the PSU
  * nuts and bolts from Prusa spares or elsewhere

## BOM (printed parts)
 * TBD
